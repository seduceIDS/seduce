# INTERFACE
# Through the interface variable you can specify the interface on which the
# sensor will listen for packets. If not set the sensor will choose the
# interface automatically. The special value "all" will results in the sensor
# trying to listen to capture packets on all interfaces.
# Default value = ""
#
# Example:
#interface = "eth0"

# SERVER ADDRESS
# The server address is the address that hosts the scheduler. In this variable
# you should also specify the port the scheduler is listeing on for incomming
# connections. Seperate the IP from the port with a : without placing any
# spaces. Instead of an IP you may also use a hostname. There are no default
# values for this option, the server address must be specified either here or
# as an input option when the sensor starts.
#
# Example:  
#server_addr = "localhost:48000"

# HOME NETWORK
# Through the home_net variable you can specify the Home Network. If the homenet
# variable is specified packets that do not have either source or destination
# address inside the home network are discarded. Home Network should be
# specified in CIDR notation. You may specify multiple, comma seperated, lists
# of IP addresses for home network. If no Home Network is specified, all packets
# visible to the interface will be send to the scheduler.
# Default value: ""
#
# NOTE: When using a home network CIDR notation keep in mind that non-network
# 	bits shouldn't be set. For example 192.168.178.1/24 isn't correct.
# 	192.168.3.0/23 isn't either. The correct ones are 192.168.178.0/24 and
# 	192.168.2.0/23. Don't blame me!!! Those are tcpdump shitty things.
#
# Example:
#home_net = "192.168.178.0/24"

# PORT LIST
# This option is used to specify a list of ports. If a port list is specified
# any connection or packet that has destination port not include in the port
# list is discarded. Individual port numbers are OK, as are ranges separated by
# a hyphen (e.g. 1-1023). The beginning and/or end values of a range may be 
# omitted, causing the sensor to use 1 and 65535, respectively. You can also
# specify a particular IP protocol by preceding the port numbers by T: or U:.
# The qualifier lasts until you specify another qualifier. For example, a value
# of U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080 would accept UDP packages with destination
# ports 53,111,and 137, as well as the listed TCP ports. If the option is
# ommited any destination port is acceptable.
# Default value = "1-65535"
#
# Example:
#port_list = "U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080"

# Enables extra checks for faulty implementations of TCP such as the ones which

# non-zero, libnids will set the NIDS_TIMED_OUT state for savagely closed
# connections.
# Default value: false
