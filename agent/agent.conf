# SERVER ADDRESS
# The server address is the address that hosts the scheduler. In this variable
# you should also specify the port the scheduler is listeing on for incomming
# connections. Seperate the IP from the port with a : without placing any
# spaces. Instead of an IP you may use a hostname too. There are no default
# values for this option, the server address must be specified either here or as
# a command line argument when the agent starts.
#
# Example:  
#server_addr = "localhost:49000"

# PASSWORD
# In order for the scheduler to serve agent's UDP requests, the agent needs to
# provide a password the first time it communicates with the scheduler. If the
# password is wrong the scheduler will ignore any further requests made by this
# specific agent. There is no default value for the password, so it must be
# explicitly set either here or as a command line argument.
#
# Example:
#password = "password"

# TIMEOUT
# Since the communication with the scheduler is done over an unreliable protocol
# (UDP), a request or an answer to a request may not reach their destination.
# The timeout value specifies the number of seconds an agent will wait after
# sending a request for an answer. A small value on a slow network may cause
# high network traffic overhead and more work for the scheduler, since the agent
# this way may consider that requests got lost when they were not. On the other
# hand a big value may leave the agent idle for a log time when a request or the
# answer to that request gets lost.
# Default value = 5
#
# Example:
#timeout = 5

# RETRIES
# When a timeout occures (see above) the agent will retry to send a request.
# Retries value determines how many times an agent will retry to send a request
# before exiting due to bad connection.
# Default value = 5
#
# Example:
#retries = 5

# NO_WORK_WAIT
# Using this variable we can set the time in seconds an agent will wait before
# retrying to get new work from the scheduler, when no work is available.
# Default value = 5
#
# Example:
#no_work_wait = 5
